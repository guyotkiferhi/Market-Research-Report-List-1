<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Structure Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrical Galvanized Structure Steel</li><li>Hot-dip Galvanized Structure Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The galvanized structure steel market consists primarily of two types: electrical galvanized structure steel and hot-dip galvanized structure steel. Electrical galvanized steel is coated with a thin layer of zinc through an electrolytic process, offering moderate corrosion resistance and a smoother finish, often used for lighter applications. In contrast, hot-dip galvanized steel involves immersing steel in molten zinc, creating a thicker, more durable coating. This type is favored for heavy-duty applications due to its superior corrosion protection and longevity.</p></p>
