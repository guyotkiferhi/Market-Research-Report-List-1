<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTCA Balloon Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Compliant</li><li>Non Compliant</li><li>Compliant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) balloon catheter market is categorized into three types based on compliance characteristics. Semi-compliant balloons expand under low pressure but have some capacity to stretch, making them suitable for challenging lesions. Non-compliant balloons maintain a fixed diameter under inflation, allowing for precise vessel expansion but limited flexibility. Compliant balloons, on the other hand, adapt to the vessel's shape during inflation, offering gentler dilation with minimal risk of vessel damage, ideal for softer lesions.</p></p>
