<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seawater Electrolysis System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Brackish Water</li><li>Brine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Seawater Electrolysis System market can be categorized into three main types: brackish water, seawater, and brine. Brackish water, a mix of freshwater and seawater, is less saline than seawater, making it suitable for electrolysis with lower energy consumption. Seawater, containing higher salt concentrations, is directly electrolyzed to produce hydrogen and chlorine. Brine, a very concentrated salt solution, can also be electrolyzed, often benefiting from processes that produce chemicals and energy simultaneously, thus serving diverse industrial applications.</p></p>
